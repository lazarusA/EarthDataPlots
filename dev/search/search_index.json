() Then, first let's start by creating some test data for EDV. dates = Date ( 2021 , 1 , 1 ) : Day ( 1 ) : Date ( 2021 , 1 , 31 ) axlist = [ RangeAxis ( \"time\" , dates ), RangeAxis ( \"lon\" , range ( 1 , 10 , length = 15 )), RangeAxis ( \"lat\" , range ( 1 , 15 , length = 20 )), CategoricalAxis ( \"Variable\" , [ \"var1\" , \"var2\" ])] data = rand ( length ( dates ), 15 , 20 , 2 ) dsarr = YAXArray ( axlist , data ) YAXArray with the following dimensions time Axis with 31 Elements from 2021-01-01 to 2021-01-31 lon Axis with 15 Elements from 1.0 to 10.0 lat Axis with 20 Elements from 1.0 to 15.0 Variable Axis with 2 elements: var1 var2 Total size: 145.31 KB And plotting our first cube is done with plotcube ( dsarr ; kind = :voxel , colormap = :linear_bmy_10_95_c71_n256 ) using plotcube will generate a cube for one of the variables in dsarr . Note that different options are available. We will take a look at one of them.
